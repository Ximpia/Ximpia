   quickstart

Server Side
===========

You start by defining your views and actions in your services using forms as way to map database fields to visual objects:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyForm(XBaseForm):
        _XP_FORM_ID = 'customer_detail'
        [... your fields with db instances inyected ...] 
        errorMessages = HiddenField(initial=_jsf.buildMsgArray([_m, ['ERR_my_error_message']]))
        okMessages = HiddenField(initial=_jsf.buildMsgArray([_m, ['success']]))

.. code-block:: python

    class MyService(CommonService):

        @view(forms.MyForm)
        def view_customer_detail(self):
            # Logic to get customer detail...

Your data layer with common operations (can extend data operations)::

    class MyDAO(CommonDAO):
        model = MyModel

And you register components to allow search, menu, workflow and other components consistency::

    self._reg.registerView(__name__, serviceName='MyService', viewName='customer_detail', slug='customer-detail', 
                            className=SiteService, method='view_customer_detail')
    self._reg.registerTemplate(__name__, viewName='customer_detail', name='customer_detail')

Front-End
=========

You define visual components as ``div`` elements in plain HTML5 template files:

.. image:: images/combo.plus.png

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="id_fromUser_comp" data-xp-type="select.plus" 
        data-xp="{  labelWidth: '100px', 
                    info: true, 
                    label: 'Sent by', 
                    helpText: 'User that sent invitation'}" > </div>


This allows your web development to be plug&play: Simply define properties for your visual objects and paste into
html5 templates.
